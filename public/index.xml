Self-employed developers work remotely for 70% of them.
Different studies could conclude different numbers based on the interviewed population, based on inclusion of self-employment, of reaching methods; likely, SO numbers could be sightly upper-bound of workforce on the amount of remote jobs.
It is made clear though, that remote job is strongly demanded for some developers.</description></item><item><title>Green It</title><link>https://princess-entrapta.github.io/blog/posts/green-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 18:53:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://princess-entrapta.github.io/blog/posts/green-it/</guid><description>Some figures about IT and the environment Electronic devices and other IT related activity represent 4% of the total global carbon footprint, a figure that is growing every year due to sector growth. If the proportion may look small, it actually is important regarding other industry sectors; automobile sector, known for its pollution side effects, in its whole is for example estimated weighting roughly 6 to 9% of global carbon emissions.</description></item><item><title>Dockerfile for small Rust images (with dependency build caching)</title><link>https://princess-entrapta.github.io/blog/posts/build-rust-dockerfile/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 12:56:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://princess-entrapta.github.io/blog/posts/build-rust-dockerfile/</guid><description>Introduction After reading multiple tutorials for building docker images and optimize them, I compiled an optimized Dockerfile that can:
Have final images that are small, in the 50MB range Benefit from docker caching, allowing to have build times under 10s if you don&amp;rsquo;t change dependencies We will assume here you start with a project my_app you already have or have created with cargo new.
Setting up We use this docker file.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://princess-entrapta.github.io/blog/about-me/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://princess-entrapta.github.io/blog/about-me/</guid><description>Coming soon</description></item></channel></rss>
